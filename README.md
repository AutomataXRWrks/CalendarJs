In this project is contained the web calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am‚Äì5pm). This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Requested aspects for the challenge where made on the code such as:

* GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner

* THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down

* THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day

* WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

* WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event

* WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

* WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
